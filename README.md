# Portfolio-Optimization-using-MPT-and-CAPM
## Project Overview
In this project, my objective is to select the best asset distribution, out of the set of all portfolios being considered so as to compare the expected portfolio return, expected volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio when minimizing the variance (risk) and when maximizing the Sharpe Ratio. I compare the expected portfolio return, expected volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio when using different approaches: Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Vs. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
## Tools
* Python
* Excel Solver
* Matplotlib & Tableau to visualize
## Methods
* Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) 
* Sharpe Ratio
* Monte Carlo Simulation
* Efficient Frontier
* Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
